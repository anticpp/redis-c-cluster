# redis-c-cluster

A c++ client library, based on hiredis, inspired by [redis-rb-cluster], supports redis cluster.
The library will cache slots data locally, refresh it when change happens, and handle redirections for redis's MOVED and ASK.

[redis-rb-cluster]: https://github.com/antirez/redis-rb-cluster

# Current support

The principle is that only data read/write commands are supported in cluster mode.
None-key commands are not supported in cluster mode, for example, INFO/SHUTDOWN.
Multi-keys commands are not supported yet, it will be in the future issue.

It's difficult to list all unsupported commands here, but you will understand the principle just mentioned.
Explicitly unsupported commands are as followed.
* INFO
* SHUTDOWN
* MULTI
* SLAVEOF
* CONFIG

# Example
  Lookup example/ for more examples.
  There are some interesting test codes in test/, you can play with them too.
```cpp
if( cluster->setup("127.0.0.1:7000, 127.0.0.1:7001", true)!=0 ) {
    std::cerr << "cluster setup fail" << std::endl;
    return 1;
}

std::vector<std::string> commands;
commands.push_back("SET");
commands.push_back("foo");
commands.push_back("hello world");
redisReply *reply = cluster->run(commands);
if( !reply ) {
    std::cerr << "(error)" << cluster->errmsg() << ", " << cluster->errno() << std::endl;
    return 1;
}

//doing some stuff

freeReplyObject(reply);
```

# Install
  ./configure && make && make install
* gtest is optional for unittest.
* hiredis is required for redis api.

# DEBUG
  To open debug message, use --debug.
  ./configure --debug

# Future
* Slave query support.
